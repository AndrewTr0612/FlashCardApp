## Technical Implementation

### Core Features Completed:

- **Array Methods**: Used `reduce()` for statistics, `filter()` for game filtering, `sort()` for top games
- **Template Literals**: Dynamic HTML generation with game information

- **Destructuring & Spread**: Used to extract top 2 games from sorted array

### Statistics Calculated:

- **Total Amount Raised**: $799,853 across all games  
- **Total Games**: 11 games in the platform

## Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
- **Flexbox Layout**: Implementing the specific 4-4-3 game card layout required careful CSS adjustments
- **Data Filtering**: Ensuring the filter functions work correctly with different game states (funded vs unfunded)
- **Search Implementation**: Creating a robust search that works across both game names and descriptions
- **Responsive Design**: Making the layout work well on different screen sizes while maintaining the desired arrangement
- **CSS Transitions**: Implementing smooth animations without affecting performance

### Solutions Implemented:
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox combination for responsive layout
- Implemented proper event handling for search functionality
- Created reusable functions for game display and DOM manipulation
- Added proper error handling for empty search results
